------------------

This is an under development (first stages) rogue style 2D RPG Engine build with LIBGDX (only classes, not development UI).

LIBGDX (http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) is a must. LIBGDX allows java cross-platform developments (html,ios,android and desktop)

To test the engine, there are also a simple testing game class called Explorer.

You can see a demo video at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWgQhCEKEgY


------------------

There are 4 projects on GIT (the pre-libgdx one, and the 3 libgdx based (main, desktop and android). All preliminary tests are based on libdgx desktop version.

For more information about running the project, refer to libgdx documentation.

Thanks!

To run jar file: (you must need Java JRE)
