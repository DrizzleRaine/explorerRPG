------------------

This is an under development (first stages) rogue style 2D RPG game with LIBGDX (only classes, not development UI).

LIBGDX (http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) is a must. LIBGDX allows java cross-platform developments (html,iOS,android and desktop)

You can see a demo video at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWgQhCEKEgY


------------------

There are 4 projects on GIT (the pre-libgdx one, and the 3 libgdx based (main, desktop and android). All preliminary tests and development are based on libdgx desktop version.

If you want to change the target device (android / desktop) you must change the OUTPUT_OS constant on the WrapperEngine class.

For more information about running the project, refer to libgdx documentation.

Thanks!

To run jar file: (you must need Java JRE)

java -jar testingGamexxx.jar or double click in some OS.
